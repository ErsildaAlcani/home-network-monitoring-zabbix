## Add media type

### Why is it useful?

Media Types define how alerts are sent to users. They act as a method to deliver alerts generated by triggers. Without media types, even if a trigger fires, Zabbix cannot notify the responsible user. In Zabbix is possibile to configure different type of medias already installed or to create a new media type.
